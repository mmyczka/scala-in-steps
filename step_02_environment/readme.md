# Step 2
# Setting up the Scala Development Environment and IDEs
Welcome to step 2 of "Scala in Steps"! Today, we will focus on setting up your Scala development environment and getting familiar with some popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that support Scala programming. A properly configured environment and a powerful IDE are crucial for a smooth and productive learning experience.
### Installing Java Development Kit (JDK)
Since Scala runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), you need a compatible JDK installed on your system. Follow these steps to install the JDK:
1. Visit the official Oracle JDK download page: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
2. Download the appropriate JDK installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
4. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the JDK installation directory.
### Installing Scala
Now that you have the JDK installed, it's time to install Scala. Follow these steps:
1. Visit the official Scala download page: https://www.scala-lang.org/download/
2. Download the appropriate Scala installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
4. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing scala -version. You should see the installed Scala version displayed.
### Installing a Scala Build Tool
A build tool is essential for managing dependencies and automating the build process. There are several build tools available for Scala, but we recommend installing sbt for this challenge. Follow these steps to install sbt:
1. Visit the official sbt download page: https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
2. Download the appropriate sbt installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
4. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing sbt -version. You should see the installed sbt version displayed.
### Choosing and Configuring an IDE
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) provides a comprehensive set of tools and features for efficient Scala development. Some popular IDEs that support Scala include:
1. IntelliJ IDEA: A powerful and versatile IDE with excellent Scala support. The Community Edition is free and includes the necessary Scala features. Download and install IntelliJ IDEA from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/. After installation, install the Scala plugin by going to Settings/Preferences > Plugins > Marketplace, searching for "Scala," and clicking the "Install" button.
2. Visual Studio Code: A lightweight, extensible code editor with support for Scala through the Metals language server. Download and install Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download. After installation, install the "Scala (Metals)" extension from the Extensions Marketplace.
3. Eclipse: A widely-used IDE with Scala support through the Scala IDE plugin. Download and install Eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. After installation, follow the instructions on the Scala IDE website (http://scala-ide.org/) to install the Scala plugin.

Now that you have your development environment set up, you are ready to dive into the world of Scala programming! In the coming days, we will explore various Scala concepts, techniques, and best practices, supported by a strong foundation of test-driven development. Stay tuned, and happy coding!
