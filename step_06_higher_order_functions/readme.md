# Step 6
## Higher-Order Functions and Anonymous Functions
Welcome to Step 6 of "Scala in Steps"! Today, we are going to explore higher-order functions and anonymous functions in Scala. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions as results. Anonymous functions, also known as function literals or lambda functions, are functions defined without a name.
### Write Tests for Higher-Order Functions
Let's start by writing tests for a higher-order function that applies a given function to an integer. In src/test/scala, create a new file named HigherOrderFunctionTest.scala and add the following tests:
```scala
import org.scalatest.flatspec.AnyFlatSpec
import org.scalatest.matchers.should.Matchers

class HigherOrderFunctionTest extends AnyFlatSpec with Matchers {
    "A higher-order function" should "correctly apply the provided function to an integer" in {
    val result1 = MathFunctions.applyFunction(_ * 2, 5)
    val result2 = MathFunctions.applyFunction(_ + 10, 7)

        result1 shouldEqual 10
        result2 shouldEqual 17
    }
}
```
Now, run the tests to see them fail initially, as we haven't yet implemented the applyFunction method.
### Implement Higher-Order Function
In src/main/scala/MathFunctions.scala, add the following higher-order function:
```scala
def applyFunction(f: Int => Int, x: Int): Int = f(x)
```
### Write Tests for Anonymous Functions
Next, let's write tests for an anonymous function that adds a given number to another number. Add the following test in HigherOrderFunctionTest.scala:
```scala
"A function" should "correctly add a given number to another number" in {
val addFive = (x: Int) => x + 5
val result = MathFunctions.applyFunction(addFive, 10)

result shouldEqual 15
}
```
Step 4: Rerun Tests
Finally, rerun the tests. This time, they should pass, as we've correctly implemented the higher-order function and anonymous function.
By following the TDD approach, you can ensure that your higher-order functions and anonymous functions are working as expected, making your code more robust and reliable.

## Exercises
1. Write a function named createMultiplier that takes an integer and returns a function that multiplies its input by the given integer.


2. Write an anonymous function that calculates the square of an integer. Use the applyFunction method from the MathFunctions object to apply this function to an integer.


3. Write a function named createAdder that takes an integer and returns a function that adds the given integer to its input.


Complete these exercises to practice writing tests and implementing higher-order functions and anonymous functions. This will help reinforce the concepts you've learned in Step 6 and improve your proficiency in Scala programming.
